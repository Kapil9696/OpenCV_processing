# OpenCV_processing
accurately detect three types of shapes (dots, circles, and diamond shapes) in an image while minimizing false positives, particularly in the detection of white diamond shapes. The original code uses OpenCV to process an image, identify contours, and classify the shapes based on their area and circularity
